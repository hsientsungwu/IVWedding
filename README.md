Ian & Vanessa Wedding Page
=========

Over the past few days, I was working on setting up Ian’s wedding page. With the help of my sister Skyiez (@BlooSkyiez)’s design, I was able to concentrate on the programming part of it. Below are the features I have so far on the page:

1. Instagram:  Thanks to my coworker Chris (@chrismorata) inspiration, I have come up with an idea of having all the wedding guest to contribute their photos by hash tagging their photos “#ivwedding”, then I connect the page with Instagram API to pull all the photos to the wedding page. And of course, I implement asynchronous call to pull from Instagram every 30 seconds in order to keep the page updated throughout the wedding. Here is the tools/plugins I have used:
*Fancybox (jQuery plugins) to create the lightbox feels when browsing photos http://fancybox.net/
*Instagram API (PHP) http://developer.instagram.com
Here is the example: http://ivwedding.latteblog.com
2. Facebook: With the help of Facebook’s Graph tools, I can easily implement Facebook comment box by generating the iframe code on Facebook developer site, and all I have done was copy and paste the code to the page.Facebook Developer: http://developer.facebook.com Here is the example: http://ivwedding.latteblog.com/blessing 
3. Gallery Slider: With the help of Nivo Slider jQuery plugins, I can easily implement a photo sliders on the wedding page. Nivo Slider: http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/ 
4. Google Analytics: In the end, in order for me to track the amount of users and visitors, I implement Google Analytic code on every bottom of my page for tracking.Google Analytics: http://www.google.com/analytics/
